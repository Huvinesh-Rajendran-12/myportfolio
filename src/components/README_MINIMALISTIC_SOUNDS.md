# Minimalistic Sound Options

Here are some minimalistic sound options for your synthwave portfolio, particularly for the navigation sound which should be more subtle:

## How to Replace the Navigate Sound

1. Download your preferred sound from one of the links above
2. Convert to MP3 format if needed (using an online converter)
3. Rename the file to `navigate.mp3`
4. Replace the existing file in your `/public/sounds/` directory

All these sounds are much smaller in file size compared to your current navigate sound (which is 756KB), which will improve load times and create a more subtle navigation experience that still fits with your synthwave aesthetic.
